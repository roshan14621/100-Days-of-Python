Type Error:
A type of error that can occur is a string and integer cannot be string concatenated.

Type Checking:
Func: type(variable)

Ex: print(type(num_char))

Type Conversion:
Converting one kind of data type to another kind of data type
Func: str(variable)

Ex: str(num_char) and then you can save it as, 
new_num_char = str(num_char)


We can use str, int and float before the variable to convert it from the present data type to the required data type.
