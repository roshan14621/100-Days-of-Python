Number Manipulation:

score = score + 1 -----> score += 1


F-String:

Its basically used to simplify code by removing unecessary amount of type conversions if they are lot in number.
Put te letter 'f' in front of a string before double quotes(" "). 


Example Problem: Life in Works:-

age = input("What is your current age?")
year = 90 - int(age)
day_year = int(year)*365
week_year = int(year)*52
month_year = int(year)*12

print(f"You have {day_year}days, {week_year}weeks, and {month_year}months left.")
